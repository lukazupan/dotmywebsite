  Cycling: I started training road cycling when I was in 7th grade of primary school. This year is my fourth one and training became much harder and more serious. I started cycling cause I watched the competitions on tv and I liked it. There are some moments of pain and sweat but at the end it's very interesting and fun.

  In the future, I want to work with computers. I want to be a graphics designer cause I like to draw and it seems like an interesting field. I got this inspiration before I decided to make this website, when me and my classmates went to visit a game developing company.

  I have a lot more hobbies than just cycling. I like to hang out with my friends a lot, sometimes outside and sometimes virtualy trought video games. I also like other sports like playing football with my friends, cross country skiing and hiking with my family.
